	cout << "Logic programming can be utilized in creating the program for controlling the actions of machines as well as express algorithms. " << endl;
	cout << "C++ was taught in the first year course. " << endl;
	cout << "The CPU, Central Processing Unit is the main chip in a computer responsible for carrying out all tasks. " << endl;
	cout << "It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.Objects can also be reused within an across applications.The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development... It makes software easier to maintain." << endl;
	cout << "Packet switching  is a mode of data transmission in which a message is broken into a number of parts which are sent independently, over whatever route is optimum for each packet, and reassembled at the destination." << endl;
	cout << "No centralization is important is because it helps in the development of managerial talent, quick decision making reducing a burden on top management, development of initiative, growth and better control. " << endl;
	cout << "Two productive things that can be done on the world wide web is learning a new language and spreading important information quickly. " << endl;
	cout << "The Internet of Things is the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to sendand receive data. " << endl;
	cout << "The compiler can teach you how the syntax is used to execute a certain line of code with no errors." << endl;
	cout << "The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. " << endl;
	cout << "TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.TCP / IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network  (an intranet or an extranet)." << endl;
	cout << "Visual Basic (VB) is a third-generation event-driven programming language from Microsoft for its Component Object Model(COM) programming model first released in 1991 and declared legacy during 2008." << endl;

	cout << "Namespace std is important because it prevents name collision in the program and avoid compiler errors. " << endl;
	cout << "I am taking COMP 1205 because it is compulsory course for Computer Science students." << endl;
	cout << " C++ is not platform dependent - in fact there is a standard that all vendors try to implement.What you mean is that the EXECUTABLE that is produced is platform dependent.That is because each OS has a different definition and requirements of what constitutes a valid executable file." << endl;
	cout << "Using system (\"pause\") pauses the execution window until you press any key. Used to allow you to view your execution output before closing the window." << endl;
	cout << "BASIC was a concurrent language invented in 1966" << endl;
	cout << "Bob Seger is a music superstar from the 1960's. " << endl;
	cout << "A concurrent programming language is defined as one which uses the concept of simultaneously executing processes or threads of execution as a means ofstructuring a program.A parallel language is able to express programs that are executable on more than one processor." << endl;
